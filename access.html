    <h1>Accessibility Page</h1>
       <b>I believe that it is important to make my website accessible to all potential uses. I have and am continuing to work to design this website for people with impairment, and for people on all internet devices and all browsers.</b>

   <h3><a id="Images" name="Images">Images</a></h3>
    <p>I have provided alternative text to images, so that visually impaired users and people using text-only browsers do not miss out on information which images on the site provide. Purely decorative images are given null attributes to visually impaired users.</p>
    
   <h3><a id="Site navigation and JavaScript" name="Site navigation and JavaScript">Site Navigation and JavaScript</a></h3>
    <p>The website uses simple text links for its navigation, this website also contains JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>In modern browsers text links in the main page content are coloured blue and are underlined, as a visual clue to its link status for the benefit of users with various forms of colour blindness. In older browsers which do not support cascading style sheets links are rendered in the default format for the browser, usually blue and underlined. Links in the Explore Further menu and the top quicklinks turn blue but do not become underlined. </p>
    
   <h3><a id="Links" name="Links">Links</a></h3>
     <p>All links on this site open in the same window, so your browser's 'back' button will always work.</p>
    
     <p>We have checked all links on this site at the time of website publication, and all links are accurate and in working order. In addition links to external sites will be periodically checked. If you find a broken link however, please contact us with details of the link text and the page on which it is located and we will fix it as soon as possible.</p>
    
   <h3><a id="Document Structure" name="Document Structure">Document Structure</a></h3>
     <p>We have designed the site with the aim of achieving maximum clarity and consistency through the site, so that recurring elements such as navigation are in the same place on the screen throughout the site to make it easy and quick to find your way around the site, and 'return to top' links at regular points in longer pages to reduce the amount you need to scroll. </p>
    
     <p>The underlying code of each page has a linear structure and HTML headings have been used so that non-visual browsers (screen readers) can read each page in a logical sequence. Neither tables nor frames are used for layout purposes.</p>
    
     <p>Every page begins with page title.</p>
    
   <h3><a id="Text size" name="Text size">Text size</a></h3>
     <p>All text on this site is resizable, including in Internet Explorer browsers. To make text bigger, use the browser's font-size tool, which is usually located under the View menu at the top of your screen. </p>
    
   <h3><a id="Screen size" name="Screen size">Screen size</a></h3>
     <p>The site has been designed to be easy to use regardless of your screen size. The text flows to the width of your screen, so you are not forced to scroll horizontally to read text if you have a small screen size, and to allow you to enjoy the full width of your screen if you have a larger computer, which also means less vertical scrolling for you. </p>
    
   <h3><a id="Browser Compatibility" name="Browser Compatibility">Browser Compatibility</a></h3>
     <p>This website uses cascading style sheets (css) for layout.</p>
    
   <h3><a id="Printing" name="Printing">Printing</a></h3>
     <p>A style sheet specifically for use by your printer is automatically used when you print a page from the File menu at the top of your browser. Text re-flows automatically to fit your printer paper, so that the page is not cut off, as is often the case when printing from the internet. Elements which are unnecessary for print, such as repeated navigation sections and purely decorative background images, are omitted to save your printer ink and paper. The font is also changed to a serif font which is widely considered more readable on paper but less so on screen, where we have provided sans-serif fonts. </p>
    
   <h3><a id="Improving" name="Improving">Improving</a></h3>
     <p>We hope that the steps we have taken make the site accessible to as many users as possible but we recognise the need to continue to improve in this area. If you have any comments or suggestions you would like to make regarding the website, please <a href="contact.html">Contact me.</a></p>
